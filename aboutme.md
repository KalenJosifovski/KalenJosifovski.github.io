title: About me

Hey, I’m Kalen — an organic chemist and aspirational data scientist. 

I’ve worked on on everything from designing new drugs to functionalising nanoparticles but my current passion lies at the intersection of medicinal chemistry and AI. 

Outside the lab (or my laptop), you’ll find me bouldering, training Muay Thai, or scuba diving. 

This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and the occasional rant.
